# NovaNook_Store_React
Here, we have an e-commerce full-stack project where I'm learning more and more features. There are two types of users: clients and admins. We have a real registration and login process where users need to confirm their email before proceeding. Each person has a cart to add items they want to buy and then confirm their order. Additionally, there is a page to show all the orders a person has made. We also have a search functionality to search for items by name and the ability to filter items by categories.

For client accounts, these features are available. However, for admin accounts, there is a different page where they can view all orders made by clients and have the ability to add or delete any item.

In the future, I plan to add more features to the project.

For the implementation, I'm using React, React Redux, various hooks and custom hooks , and tailwind in the frontend. In the backend, I'm utilizing Supabase to create a complete database and manage authentication.
